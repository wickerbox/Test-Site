I can't find the images of the final motor driver boards, but I never soldered any together anyway. I laid this board out for Steve at Eulerworks for Terry's house-lifting project. There were a lot of red flags that later proved out -- Chris was unreliable, Steve is overcommitted and can rationalize all of his bad behavior into being other people's fault.

That said, doing this project netted me $800 and some goodwill from Steve.
