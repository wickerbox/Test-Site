This was a project for a local guy who wants to sell a shower head that counts down green LEDs until they flash red when time runs out. That way, you can stop taking such long showers.

He really didn't like the idea of a board and I didn't do a good job of convincing him a board would have been easier (it would have been) so I went with a Teensy and vastly underestimated the time it would take to solder everything up. 

I cut the cap off a Chinese shower head with LEDs from China, and stuffed everything into the body. This was my first project with LiPO charging. I ran a mini-USB cable out the back to recharge the LiPO, which powered a Teensy.

I'm surprised the thing still works, but he seems to have shown it to several investors and seems happy enough.
