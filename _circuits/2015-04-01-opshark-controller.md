This was a project for the Portland Mini Maker Fair shark robots, which I've never seen actually functioning as of early 2016. This was also the project that I realized that Dan was so full of shit, he didn't have any idea how full of shit he was. The controller came out nice, though. 

There was a subsequent revision that tented the vias.
