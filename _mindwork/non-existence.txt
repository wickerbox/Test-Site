What do you do when faced with the evidence of your own non-existence? What if, one evening, the world has two moons? In 1Q84, the Leader attributes responsibility to the Little People. Where Amomoe and Tengo still strive to determine their own places in the scheme of things, the Leader has given up and accepted it, in a terrible and reprehensible way. But regardless of their magical powers or their attitudes towards their situation, the situation is the same: all three of them are still stuck in 1Q84. None of them has any control. Tengo and Amomoe just haven't accepted it yet. 

The illusion of self-determination isn't present all the time, but it's still strong enough to overwhelm me when it occurs. This is the most convincing evidence for consistent daily meditation. It's not that I need the meditation to seek towards some goal, but that I already have achieved everything and just need a reminder of what that state feels like.

It seems like the self-determination illusion is a habit that needs to be unlearned.

This is the most banal conversation ever.
